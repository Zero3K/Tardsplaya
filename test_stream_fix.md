# Stream Freezing Fix Verification

## Changes Made

### Primary Fix: HTTP Server Data Streaming (stream_pipe.cpp:147-198)
- **Reduced wait time** from 50ms to 10ms when no data is available to minimize gaps
- **Added timeout counter** to detect when no data is available for too long (5 seconds max)
- **Improved logging** to track empty queue occurrences and prevent infinite waits

### Secondary Fix: Enhanced Buffer Management (stream_pipe.cpp:860-905)
- **Multi-segment feeding** - Feed multiple segments at once to HTTP server queue
- **Minimum queue size maintenance** - Keep at least 3 segments in HTTP server queue
- **Adaptive feeding** - Feed based on current HTTP server queue size
- **Improved startup** - Pre-feed HTTP server during initialization

### Technical Improvements
- **Continuous data flow** - Prevents gaps that cause video freezing while audio continues
- **Better synchronization** - Download and feeder threads coordinate more effectively
- **Flow control** - Maintains adequate buffer levels to prevent underruns

## Expected Results
1. **No more video freezing** while audio continues playing
2. **Smoother playback** with fewer interruptions
3. **Better multi-stream stability** when running multiple streams simultaneously
4. **Faster recovery** from temporary network issues

## Test Instructions
1. Start Tardsplaya and open a Twitch stream
2. Watch for 5-10 minutes to verify no freezing occurs
3. Test with multiple streams to ensure stability
4. Monitor logs for improved buffer management messages
5. Verify audio and video stay synchronized throughout playback

## Root Cause Addressed
The primary cause was the 50ms delays in HTTP data streaming that created gaps in the video stream. Media players interpret these gaps as discontinuities, causing video to freeze while audio buffers continue playing. By reducing delays and maintaining continuous data flow, the freezing issue is resolved.
