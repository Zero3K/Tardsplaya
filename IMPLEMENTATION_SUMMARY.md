# MPEG-TS Demux Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive MPEG-TS demuxing functionality to Tardsplaya using the demux-mpegts library by janbar. The feature addresses the issue of media players getting stuck on black screens with continuing audio after discontinuities by separating video and audio streams into individual files.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### ✅ Core Requirements (Issue #124)

1. **Use demux-mpegts to demux video and audio streams**
   - Integrated demux-mpegts library as git submodule
   - Created `MpegTSDemuxer` class with full API integration
   - Processes MPEG-TS packets and extracts elementary streams

2. **Help media players recover from discontinuities**
   - Separate video and audio files enable independent stream recovery
   - Reduces black screen/audio desync issues
   - Players handle elementary streams more robustly

3. **Send audio and video separately**
   - Creates individual files for each detected stream
   - Video: `.h264`, `.h265`, `.m2v` formats
   - Audio: `.aac`, `.mp3`, `.ac3` formats

4. **Full, not minimal implementation**
   - Complete production-ready solution
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - UI integration and configuration
   - Multi-player support with proper command line generation

5. **Media player compatibility**
   - **MPC-HC/MPC-BE**: `/dub filename` parameter ✅
   - **VLC**: `--input-slave=filename` parameter ✅  
   - **MPV**: `--audio-file=filename` parameter ✅

## Technical Architecture

### Core Classes

1. **`MpegTSDemuxer`**
   - Extends `TSDemux::TSDemuxer` interface
   - Manages buffer and processes MPEG-TS packets
   - Creates and writes elementary stream files
   - Handles stream detection and codec identification

2. **`DemuxStreamManager`**
   - High-level streaming coordination
   - Manages download, demux, and player threads
   - Handles playlist parsing and segment downloading
   - Coordinates player launch with appropriate command line

3. **`MediaPlayerCommandBuilder`**
   - Detects player type from executable path
   - Generates correct command line for each player type
   - Supports MPC-HC, VLC, and MPV formats

### Integration Points

1. **Streaming Mode Enumeration**
   ```cpp
   enum class StreamingMode {
       HLS_SEGMENTS,      // Traditional HLS
       TRANSPORT_STREAM,  // TSDuck routing
       TX_QUEUE_IPC,     // High-performance mode
       DEMUX_MPEGTS      // NEW: Separate A/V streams
   };
   ```

2. **Settings UI Integration**
   - Added combobox to settings dialog
   - Persistent configuration via INI file
   - User-selectable streaming mode

3. **Main Application Integration**
   - Updated `StartStreamThread` to support demux mode
   - Integrated with existing logging and status systems
   - Maintains compatibility with existing modes

## Features Added

### Stream Processing
- Real-time MPEG-TS packet demuxing
- Elementary stream detection and classification
- Separate file creation per PID/stream type
- Automatic codec detection (H.264, H.265, AAC, AC-3, etc.)

### Player Integration
- Automatic player type detection
- Command line generation for different players
- Support for separate audio track parameters
- Process management and cleanup

### User Experience
- Settings dialog integration
- Real-time logging and progress tracking
- Stream statistics and monitoring
- Temporary file management

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Detailed debug logging
- Recovery mechanisms

## Output Example

When demux mode is active:
```
%TEMP%/Tardsplaya_Demux_channelname_timestamp/
├── stream_channelname_0256.h264    # Video (PID 256)
├── stream_channelname_0257.aac     # Audio (PID 257)
└── [additional streams...]
```

Player launch example:
```bash
# MPV
mpv.exe "video.h264" --audio-file="audio.aac"

# VLC  
vlc.exe "video.h264" --input-slave="audio.aac"

# MPC-HC
mpc-hc.exe "video.h264" /dub "audio.aac"
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- Reduced stream interruption issues
- Better playback quality during network problems
- Support for multiple media players
- Easy mode switching via settings

### For Developers
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible architecture for additional formats
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Well-documented API integration

## Testing

Comprehensive testing guide provided in `DEMUX_TESTING_GUIDE.md`:
- Basic functionality testing
- Multi-player compatibility testing
- Stream recovery testing
- Performance validation

## Compatibility

- **OS**: Windows 7+ (existing requirement)
- **Build**: Visual Studio 2015+ (existing requirement)
- **Players**: MPV, VLC, MPC-HC, MPC-BE
- **Streams**: All MPEG-TS compatible Twitch streams

## Performance Impact

- **CPU**: Slight increase due to demux processing
- **Memory**: ~1MB buffer per stream (configurable)
- **Storage**: Temporary files in system temp directory
- **Network**: Same as existing modes

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:
- Additional codec support (AV1, VP9, etc.)
- Custom player command line templates
- Stream quality per-track selection
- Advanced synchronization options

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete solution for MPEG-TS demuxing in Tardsplaya, addressing all requirements from issue #124. The integration is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, UI integration, and support for multiple media players.

The separate video/audio stream approach should significantly improve playback robustness during network discontinuities, providing a better user experience for Twitch stream viewing.
