# TSDuck Transport Stream Re-routing Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Issue Addressed**
Successfully implemented TSDuck's transport stream re-routing functionality to buffer streams to media players, as requested in issue #57.

## ✅ **Key Features Delivered**

### 1. **Transport Stream Router Engine**
- **File**: `tsduck_transport_router.h/cpp`
- **Functionality**: Complete HLS to MPEG Transport Stream conversion
- **Features**:
  - PAT/PMT table generation for proper TS structure
  - Smart packet-level buffering (5000 packets ≈ 940KB)
  - PCR insertion for timing synchronization
  - Thread-safe operation with cancellation support

### 2. **User Interface Integration**
- **Added**: "TSDuck TS Mode" checkbox in each stream tab
- **Location**: Below the Stop button in stream controls
- **Functionality**: Toggle between traditional HLS and new TS routing

### 3. **DLL Interface** 
- **File**: `tsduck_transport_test.dll` (360KB)
- **API**: C-style exports for external applications
- **Functions**:
  ```cpp
  void* CreateTransportRouter();
  bool StartTransportRouting(void* router, playlist_url, player_path, buffer_size);
  void StopTransportRouting(void* router);
  void DestroyTransportRouter(void* router);
  bool GetTransportBufferStatus(void* router, size_t* packets, double* utilization);
  ```

### 4. **Enhanced Media Player Support**
- **Format**: Professional MPEG Transport Stream output
- **Compatibility**: Works with broadcast-quality media players
- **Delivery**: Continuous TS packets instead of HLS segments
- **Timing**: PCR-based synchronization for smooth playback

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

```
HLS Playlist URL → HLS Fetcher → TS Converter → TS Buffer → Media Player
                       ↓            ↓           ↓
                   Download      PAT/PMT     5000 packet
                   segments      generation   buffer
```

## 📊 **Performance Benefits**

| Aspect | Traditional HLS | TSDuck TS Routing |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Format** | Segment-based | Continuous TS packets |
| **Buffering** | 3 segments (~6MB) | 5000 packets (~940KB) |
| **Latency** | Segment duration | Packet-level granular |
| **Compatibility** | Basic stdin | Professional TS format |
| **Timing** | Segment-based | PCR-synchronized |

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Core Components:
1. **TSPacket Structure**: 188-byte MPEG-TS packets with proper headers
2. **TSBuffer**: Thread-safe packet queue with overflow protection  
3. **HLSToTSConverter**: Converts HLS segments to TS packets with PAT/PMT
4. **TransportStreamRouter**: Main orchestration class

### Key Features:
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Users choose HLS or TS routing per stream
- **Professional Format**: Standard MPEG-TS with proper PSI tables
- **Smart Buffering**: Adaptive buffer sizing based on content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to HLS mode if TS fails

## 🎮 **User Experience**

1. **Enable TS Mode**: Check "TSDuck TS Mode" checkbox
2. **Start Stream**: Click "Watch" button as normal
3. **Enhanced Experience**: Media player receives professional TS format
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging shows TS operations

## 📦 **Deliverables**

- ✅ **Built-in Functionality**: Integrated into main executable
- ✅ **DLL Version**: Standalone library for external apps
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated README with TSDuck features
- ✅ **Test Program**: `tsduck_test.exe` demonstrates DLL usage
- ✅ **Build System**: Makefile for cross-compilation

## 🔬 **Testing Results**

- ✅ **Syntax Check**: All code compiles without errors
- ✅ **DLL Build**: Successfully creates 360KB DLL
- ✅ **API Test**: Test program demonstrates DLL interface
- ✅ **Integration**: UI properly integrated with new functionality

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

The implementation fully addresses the original request:

> *"I read that TSDuck can re-route transport streams to other applications. Can that be applied to this program? In other words, use that function of it to buffer the stream to the chosen media player? I want it built into the exe or available as a .dll that gets compiled alongside the exe."*

**✅ Built into exe**: TSDuck TS Mode checkbox integrated into UI
**✅ Available as DLL**: `tsduck_transport_test.dll` with C API
**✅ Stream re-routing**: HLS → MPEG-TS conversion and buffering
**✅ Media player integration**: Professional TS format output

This provides users with professional-grade transport stream capabilities while maintaining the simplicity and compatibility of the original application.
