# Tardsplaya

A Twitch stream player for Windows with enhanced TLS support.

## Features

- Multi-tab stream viewing
- Quality selection
- Windows 7+ compatibility
- **Enhanced TLS Client Support** - Custom TLS implementation for better compatibility with older Windows versions

## TSDuck Integration for Enhanced Performance

This version includes **TSDuck-inspired HLS processing** for improved streaming performance and reduced lag.

### Performance Enhancements

- **Advanced HLS Parsing**: TSDuck-inspired playlist analysis with precise timing calculations
- **Smart Buffering**: Dynamic buffer sizing based on stream characteristics
- **Enhanced Ad Detection**: Sophisticated SCTE-35 and pattern-based ad detection
- **Optimized Timing**: Better segment timing for smoother playback

### NEW: Frame Number Tagging for Lag Reduction

**Frame Number Tagging** - Advanced frame tracking and monitoring system:

- **Frame Sequence Tracking**: Each transport stream packet receives unique frame numbers for precise ordering
- **Drop Detection**: Automatically detects and reports dropped frames that can cause lag
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate or reordered frames that may indicate network issues  
- **Key Frame Identification**: Marks I-frames and key frames for better buffering decisions
- **Real-time Statistics**: Displays current FPS, frame drops, and timing information
- **Lag Analysis**: Provides detailed frame timing data to help identify lag sources

### Technical Details

Frame Number Tagging enhances the existing TSDuck transport stream system:

- **TSPacket Enhancement**: Added frame numbering, timing, and metadata to each packet
- **HLS Converter Integration**: Assigns frame numbers during segment conversion
- **Statistical Monitoring**: Tracks frame rates, drops, and timing across all streams
- **Debug Logging**: Detailed frame information for troubleshooting lag issues
- **Status Display**: Real-time frame statistics in the status bar

- **Stream Re-routing**: Routes HLS streams through transport stream format to media players
- **Built-in by Default**: TSDuck TS Mode is now the standard streaming method
- **Smart Buffering**: Packet-level buffering (~5000 packets default, ~940KB) for smoother playback
- **PAT/PMT Generation**: Proper MPEG-TS structure with Program Association and Program Map tables
- **PCR Insertion**: Program Clock Reference timing for better synchronization

### Technical Details

The TSDuck integration includes:

- `tsduck_hls_wrapper.h/cpp` - Lightweight TSDuck-inspired HLS parser
- `tsduck_transport_router.h/cpp` - **NEW** Transport stream re-routing engine with **VirtualDub2-style discontinuity handling**
- Enhanced playlist analysis with precise duration calculations  
- Dynamic buffer optimization based on stream characteristics
- Advanced ad detection using multiple detection patterns
- SCTE-35 processing for professional-grade ad handling
- **🎯 VirtualDub2 Discontinuity Handling** - Prevents black frame sticking after advertisement breaks

### NEW: VirtualDub2-Style Discontinuity Handling

**Advanced Ad Break Recovery** - Implements proven VirtualDub2 discontinuity handling methodology:

- **Keyframe Waiting**: After detecting discontinuities (ad breaks), waits for keyframes before resuming playback
- **Black Frame Prevention**: Skips non-keyframes that could cause black/corrupted frames in media players
- **Timeout Protection**: Maximum 30-frame wait (VirtualDub2 standard) prevents indefinite blocking
- **Dual Detection**: Handles both playlist-level (`#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`) and packet-level discontinuities
- **Smooth Recovery**: Ensures clean visual transitions back to main content after advertisements

**How It Works:**
```
[Normal Stream] → [Ad Break] → [Discontinuity] → [Skip non-keyframes] → [KEYFRAME FOUND] → [Resume Normal]
                                      ↓                    ↓                    ↓
                              Buffer cleared     Wait max 30 frames    Clean visual recovery
```

### Performance Benefits

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Buffer Management | Static 3 segments | Dynamic 2-8 segments based on content |
| Ad Detection | Basic pattern matching | TSDuck-style multi-pattern analysis |
| Timing Precision | Basic duration parsing | Millisecond-precise calculations |
| Lag Reduction | Manual tuning | Automatic optimization + Frame Number Tagging |
| **Frame Tracking** | **No frame monitoring** | **Real-time frame numbering and drop detection** |
| **Lag Analysis** | **Basic logging only** | **Detailed frame statistics and timing data** |
| **Stream Format** | **HLS segments only** | **HLS segments + Transport Stream routing** |
| **Player Compatibility** | **Basic stdin piping** | **Professional TS format support** |
| **🎯 Ad Break Recovery** | **❌ Black frames/sticking** | **✅ VirtualDub2 keyframe waiting** |
| **Discontinuity Handling** | **❌ No special handling** | **✅ Dual-level detection & recovery** |

The integration works transparently:
1. **Primary**: TSDuck-enhanced parsing for optimal performance
2. **Fallback**: Original parsing if TSDuck analysis fails
3. **Dynamic**: Buffer sizes adjust automatically based on content
4. **NEW**: Optional transport stream re-routing for professional media players

### TSDuck Transport Stream Mode (Default)

**Default Streaming Mode**: TSDuck TS Mode is now the standard streaming method:

- **Automatic Conversion**: HLS segments → MPEG Transport Stream packets
- **Professional Format**: Standard broadcast-quality TS format
- **Enhanced Buffering**: Packet-level buffering instead of segment buffering  
- **Better Compatibility**: Works with professional media players expecting TS format
- **Reduced Latency**: Continuous stream instead of segment-based delivery

TSDuck TS Mode provides superior performance and compatibility compared to traditional HLS segment streaming.

## Troubleshooting Ad Breaks and Black Frames

### Common Issues After Ad Breaks
- **Black frames or frozen video**: Now prevented by VirtualDub2 discontinuity handling
- **Audio continues but video stops**: Keyframe waiting ensures proper video restart
- **Player crashes during ad transitions**: Buffer clearing and keyframe synchronization provides stability

### Debug Logs to Monitor
```
[DISCONTINUITY] Detected ad transition - implementing fast restart
[KEYFRAME_WAIT] Activated keyframe waiting mode (max 30 frames)  
[KEYFRAME_WAIT] Found keyframe after 5 frames - resuming normal playback
```

### If Issues Persist
1. Check that streams have regular keyframes (every 2-10 seconds)
2. Verify media player supports TS format input
3. Monitor for timeout messages (may indicate streams without keyframes)
4. Check network stability during ad transitions

## TLS Client Integration

This version includes an integrated TLS client from the [tlsclient](https://github.com/zero3k/tlsclient) repository, providing:

- **TLS 1.2/1.3 Support**: Modern encryption standards
- **Windows 7 Compatibility**: Better HTTPS support on older Windows versions
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically switches to TLS client when WinHTTP fails
- **Certificate Bypass**: Designed for compatibility without strict certificate validation

### Technical Details

The TLS client integration includes:

- `tlsclient.h/cpp` - Main TLS client wrapper
- Crypto components: `chacha20.c`, `ecc.c`, `gcm.c`, `sha2.c`
- TLS protocol implementation: `tls.h`, `tlsclient_source.cpp`
- Thread-safe locking: `lock.h`

The integration works as a fallback system:
1. Primary: WinHTTP (standard Windows HTTP library)
2. Fallback: Custom TLS client (when WinHTTP fails or on older systems)

## Building

Requires Visual Studio 2015 or later. The project includes all necessary TLS client components and will compile them automatically.

## Compatibility

- Windows 7 SP1 and later
- Enhanced TLS support for older Windows versions
- Automatically handles TLS compatibility issues - Twitch Stream Buffer

A C++ application that buffers Twitch streams to media players like MPC-HC, MPC-BE, VLC, and MPV.

## Features

- **Multiple Quality Support**: Automatically detects and allows selection of available stream qualities
- **Multi-Stream Support**: Open multiple tabs to watch different streams simultaneously
- **Windows 7 Compatibility**: Includes certificate validation workarounds for older Windows versions
- **Real-time Logging**: Shows detailed logs of streaming operations
- **Modern C++ Implementation**: Clean, efficient C++17 code with minimal dependencies

## Requirements

- Windows 7 or later
- Media player (MPV recommended, also supports VLC, MPC-HC, MPC-BE)
