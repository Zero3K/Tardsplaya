# DirectShow Integration for Tardsplaya

## Overview

Tardsplaya now includes **DirectShow-compatible streaming** that provides enhanced discontinuity handling for media players like MPC-HC, MPC-BE, VLC, and Windows Media Player. This feature leverages Tardsplaya's advanced transport stream processing to deliver superior stream quality with automatic discontinuity detection and correction.

## Features

### Enhanced Discontinuity Handling
- **Automatic Detection**: Real-time detection of stream discontinuities and timing issues
- **Frame Number Tagging**: Each transport stream packet receives unique frame numbers for precise ordering
- **Drop Detection**: Automatically detects and reports dropped frames that can cause lag
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate or reordered frames indicating network issues
- **Key Frame Identification**: Marks I-frames and key frames for better buffering decisions

### Transport Stream Enhancements
- **PAT/PMT Repetition**: Program Association Table and Program Map Table repetition for rapid resync after discontinuities
- **PCR Insertion**: Program Clock Reference timing for better synchronization
- **Professional TS Format**: Standard broadcast-quality MPEG Transport Stream output
- **Low-Latency Mode**: Aggressive packet-level buffering for reduced stream delay

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Stream Health Statistics**: Live monitoring of video/audio stream health
- **Performance Metrics**: Current FPS, frame drops, timing information, and bitrate
- **Discontinuity Count**: Track the number of discontinuities handled
- **Buffer Utilization**: Monitor buffer status and utilization

## How to Use

### 1. Enable DirectShow Mode
1. Load your desired Twitch channel in Tardsplaya
2. Click "1. Load" to fetch available stream qualities
3. Select your preferred quality from the dropdown
4. Click the **"DirectShow"** button (appears after loading qualities)

### 2. Configure Your Media Player

#### For MPC-HC (Recommended)
1. Open MPC-HC
2. Go to **File → Open File** (Ctrl+O)
3. In the file dialog, paste the named pipe path shown in Tardsplaya
   - Example: `\\.\pipe\TardsplayaStream_channelname`
4. Click Open
5. The stream will start with enhanced discontinuity handling

#### For VLC Media Player
1. Open VLC
2. Go to **Media → Open Network Stream** (Ctrl+N)
3. In the network URL field, enter the named pipe path
   - Example: `\\.\pipe\TardsplayaStream_channelname`
4. Click Play

#### For Windows Media Player
1. Open Windows Media Player
2. Press **Ctrl+U** or go to **File → Open URL**
3. Enter the named pipe path
4. Press OK

### 3. Monitor Stream Status
- Tardsplaya will display real-time statistics in the status bar
- Log messages will show DirectShow connection status
- Stream health metrics are continuously updated

## Advanced Configuration

### DirectShow Settings
The DirectShow integration includes several configurable options:

```cpp
// Default configuration (automatically applied)
- Enhanced discontinuity handling: Enabled
- Frame number tagging: Enabled  
- PAT/PMT repetition: Every 100ms
- PCR insertion: Every 40ms
- Buffer size: 8000 packets (~1.5MB)
- Low-latency mode: Enabled
```

### Named Pipe Configuration
- **Path Format**: `\\.\pipe\TardsplayaStream_{channel_name}`
- **Access**: Output-only (Tardsplaya writes, player reads)
- **Buffer Size**: 8KB output buffer
- **Type**: Byte-oriented pipe with message mode

## Benefits Over Standard Streaming

| Feature | Standard HLS | DirectShow Mode |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Discontinuity Detection | Manual/Player-dependent | Automatic real-time detection |
| Frame Numbering | None | Unique frame sequence numbers |
| Timing Accuracy | Variable | Millisecond-precise with PCR |
| Buffer Management | Segment-based (3+ segments) | Packet-level (8000 packets) |
| Resync Speed | 6-30 seconds | Immediate with PAT/PMT repetition |
| Stream Format | Raw HLS segments | Professional MPEG-TS |
| Lag Reduction | Limited | Advanced frame tagging |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"DirectShow button is disabled"**
- Ensure you've loaded a channel and selected a quality first
- Verify DirectShow is supported on your system (Windows Vista+)
- Check that no other streaming is active in the same tab

**"Failed to create named pipe"**
- Named pipes require Windows Vista or later
- Ensure sufficient system resources
- Try restarting Tardsplaya if pipe creation fails

**"Media player cannot connect"**
- Verify the named pipe path is copied correctly
- Ensure DirectShow streaming is active in Tardsplaya (status shows "DirectShow mode active")
- Try a different media player (MPC-HC is most compatible)

**"Stream stutters or has quality issues"**
- Monitor the discontinuity count in Tardsplaya logs
- Check network connection stability
- Try a lower quality stream if network is unstable

### Performance Optimization

**For Low-End Systems:**
- Use smaller buffer sizes (reduce from 8000 to 5000 packets)
- Disable frame number tagging if CPU usage is high
- Use lower stream qualities

**For High-Performance Systems:**
- Increase buffer size to 15000+ packets for ultra-smooth playback
- Enable verbose logging for detailed stream analysis
- Use highest available stream quality

## Technical Details

### Stream Processing Pipeline
1. **HLS Segment Download**: Tardsplaya downloads HLS segments from Twitch
2. **Transport Stream Conversion**: Segments are converted to MPEG-TS packets
3. **Frame Number Tagging**: Each packet receives unique frame identifiers
4. **Discontinuity Analysis**: Real-time analysis for timing issues and gaps
5. **PAT/PMT Insertion**: Regular insertion of program tables for quick resync
6. **PCR Generation**: Program Clock Reference for accurate timing
7. **Named Pipe Output**: Professional TS format delivered to media player

### Compatibility Matrix

| Media Player | Compatibility | Features |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| MPC-HC | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Full support, best performance |
| MPC-BE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Full support, excellent performance |
| VLC | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good support, some latency |
